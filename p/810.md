Congratulations!

"I dreamed it all ever since I was young. They said I wouldn't be nothing. Now they always say, 'Congratulations'. Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation. They ain't never had dedication. People hatin' say we changed and look, we made it. Yeah, we made it."

Congratulations on passing the PPPK test this year my dearest. Be the best teacher for your students. Do no harm. Glad to see you happy for this achievement!
