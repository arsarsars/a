### Note
Summer advice for soon to be graduates with no job lined up, by Ricky Van Veen
>Learn programming language (Phyton or Ror) during the weekdays. Hang out with your friends on weeknights. On weekends, rent somebody's parents Suburban and be an Uber driver in the closest wealthy vacation town. Take your parents out to dinner once, with the rest of the money. Spend half on yourself. Save a quarter of it. Put the rest in Amazon and Facebook stock. Don't pay attention to the price of the stock market for ten years.

>Run every other day.

>Keep your eye out for somebody special. Take them on a date, not a group hang. Watch two Charlie Rose episodes a week without looking at your phone. The week after Labor Day, go on a day vacation some affordable but interesting. Air Asia has flights to Cartagena, for example. When you get back, look for a job and build something neat with your programming skills.

>Have a bitchin' summer everybody.

### From Hanny 'Beradadisini'

>I would like to simply enjoy the feeling of being me, of being alone, of reconnecting with myself, of doing things for the sake of doing it–not for social media.

### From Jason Zweig article, "Did You Beat the Market?",

>Finally, ask yourself why you want to beat the market anyway. I once interviewed dozens of residents in Boca Raton, one of Florida’s richest retirement communities. Amid the elegant stucco homes, the manicured lawns, the swaying palm trees, the sun and the sea breezes, I asked these folks — mostly in their seventies — if they’d beaten the market over the course of their investing lifetimes. Some said yes, some said no. Then one man said, “Who cares? All I know is, my investments earned enough for me to end up in Boca.”

>I can’t imagine a better answer. After all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to reach your own goals. The best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you’re beating the market but by whether your investments are growing steadily and rapidly enough to get you where you want to go. That means that staying put, in an index fund or even in a fund that is underperforming the S&P by a point or two, is better than climbing onto the whizzing treadmill of trying to beat the market. In the end, what matters isn’t crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making sure that you do cross it.
