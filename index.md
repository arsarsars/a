### Note
Summer advice for soon to be graduates with no job lined up, by Ricky Van Veen
>Learn programming language (Phyton or Ror) during the weekdays. Hang out with your friends on weeknights. On weekends, rent somebody's parents Suburban and be an Uber driver in the closest wealthy vacation town. Take your parents out to dinner once, with the rest of the money. Spend half on yourself. Save a quarter of it. Put the rest in Amazon and Facebook stock. Don't pay attention to the price of the stock market for ten years.

>Run every other day.

>Keep your eye out for somebody special. Take them on a date, not a group hang. Watch two Charlie Rose episodes a week without looking at your phone. The week after Labor Day, go on a day vacation some affordable but interesting. Air Asia has flights to Cartagena, for example. When you get back, look for a job and build something neat with your programming skills.

>Have a bitchin' summer everybody.
